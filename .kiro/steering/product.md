# Product Overview

## WebGL Symmetry Paint PoC

A proof-of-concept WebGL-based symmetrical drawing application designed to validate performance and technical feasibility for brush pattern creation tools.

### Core Purpose

- Performance validation of WebGL rendering for symmetrical drawing
- Technical feasibility assessment for replacing Canvas2D implementations
- Foundation technology for future brush pattern creation tools

### Key Features

- **Real-time symmetrical drawing**: 8-axis radial symmetry with center point at (512, 512)
- **WebGL rendering**: High-performance drawing engine targeting 60fps
- **Zoom and tiling**: Preview patterns with seamless tiling when zoomed out
- **Pressure sensitivity**: Support for Apple Pencil and Wacom devices
- **Performance monitoring**: Real-time FPS, memory usage, and input latency metrics

### Target Users

- Developers evaluating WebGL performance for drawing applications
- Technical stakeholders assessing feasibility for production implementation
- Artists and designers testing symmetrical pattern creation workflows

### Success Criteria

- Maintain 60fps during continuous drawing operations
- Support real-time 8-axis symmetry without visible lag
- Demonstrate memory-efficient WebGL implementation
- Provide comprehensive performance metrics for evaluation
